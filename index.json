Occlusion is a well established method that provides explanations on discrete language data, e.g. by removing a language unit from an input and measuring the impact on a model's decision. We argue that current occlusion-based methods often produce invalid or syntactically incorrect language data, neglecting the improved abilities of recent NLP models. Furthermore, gradient-based explanation methods disregard the discrete distribution of data in NLP. Thus, we propose OLM: a novel explanation method that combines occlusion and language models to sample valid and syntactically correct replacements with high likelihood, given the context of the original input. We lay out a theoretical foundation that alleviates these weaknesses of other explanation methods in NLP and provide results that underline the importance of considering data likelihood in occlusion-based explanation.","tags":[],"title":"Considering Likelihood in NLP Classification Explanations with Occlusion and Language Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Aleksandra Gabryszak","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592524800,"objectID":"356c202a7a495c323b56244cdfaa64af","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/probing-linguistic/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T19:09:25+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/probing-linguistic/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite the recent progress, little is known about the features captured by state-of-the-art neural relation extraction (RE) models. Common methods encode the source sentence, conditioned on the entity mentions, before classifying the relation. However, the complexity of the task makes it difficult to understand how encoder architecture and supporting linguistic knowledge affect the features learned by the encoder. We introduce 14 probing tasks targeting linguistic properties relevant to RE, and we use them to study representations learned by more than 40 different encoder architecture and linguistic feature combinations trained on two datasets, TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8. We find that the bias induced by the architecture and the inclusion of linguistic features are clearly expressed in the probing task performance. For example, adding contextualized word representations greatly increases performance on probing tasks with a focus on named entity and part-of-speech information, and yields better results in RE. In contrast, entity masking improves RE, but considerably lowers performance on entity type related probing tasks.","tags":[],"title":"Probing Linguistic Features of Sentence-level Representations in Neural Relation Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Aleksandra Gabryszak","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1592524800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592524800,"objectID":"410e295227c53234c99f5885bd7bda07","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/tacred-revisited/","publishdate":"2020-05-13T19:09:17+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/tacred-revisited/","section":"publication","summary":"TACRED (Zhang et al., 2017) is one of the largest, most widely used crowdsourced datasets in Relation Extraction (RE). But, even with recent advances in unsupervised pre-training and knowledge enhanced neural RE, models still show a high error rate. In this paper, we investigate the questions: Have we reached a performance ceiling or is there still room for improvement? And how do crowd annotations, dataset, and models contribute to this error rate? To answer these questions, we first validate the most challenging 5K examples in the development and test sets using trained annotators. We find that label errors account for 8% absolute F1 test error, and that more than 50% of the examples need to be relabeled. On the relabeled test set the average F1 score of a large baseline model set improves from 62.1 to 70.1. After validation, we analyze misclassifications on the challenging instances, categorize them into linguistically motivated error groups, and verify the resulting error hypotheses on three state-of-the-art RE models. We show that two groups of ambiguous relations are responsible for most of the remaining errors and that models may adopt shallow heuristics on the dataset when entities are not masked.","tags":[],"title":"TACRED Revisited: A Thorough Evaluation of the TACRED Relation Extraction Task","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Schwarzenberg","Marc Hübner","David Harbecke","Christoph Alt","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1569476323,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569476323,"objectID":"3046496158305b5930b85c22a137148d","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/layerwise-relevance/","publishdate":"2019-09-26T07:38:43+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/layerwise-relevance/","section":"publication","summary":"Representations in the hidden layers of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are often hard to interpret since it is difficult to project them into an interpretable domain. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) allow this projection, but existing explainability methods do not exploit this fact, i.e. do not focus their explanations on intermediate states. In this work, we present a novel method that traces and visualizes features that contribute to a classification decision in the visible and hidden layers of a GCN. Our method exposes hidden cross-layer dynamics in the input graph structure. We experimentally demonstrate that it yields meaningful layerwise explanations for a GCN sentence classifier.","tags":[],"title":"Layerwise Relevance Visualization in Convolutional Text Graph Classifiers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564358400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564358400,"objectID":"e81f6dcb47ba4246eadfaeeefef05f9b","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/fine-tuning/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:09:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/fine-tuning/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that generative language model pre-training combined with selective attention improves recall for long-tail relations in distantly supervised neural relation extraction.","tags":[],"title":"Fine-Tuning Pre-Trained Transformer Language Models to Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christoph Alt","Marc Hübner","Leonhard Hennig"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1558310400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558310400,"objectID":"1ee44b0a7f9c1313e0f341180a18cd8b","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/improving-relation/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:10+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/improving-relation/","section":"publication","summary":"We show that transfer learning through generative language model pre-training improves supervised neural relation extraction, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8.","tags":[],"title":"Improving Relation Extraction by Pre-Trained Language Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roland Roller","Christoph Alt","Laura Seiffe","He Wang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1543622400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1543622400,"objectID":"f1a111cc08757da0239462291892fc51","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/mex/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:19+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/mex/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"mEx - an Information Extraction Platform for German Medical Text","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David Harbecke","Robert Schwarzenberg","Christoph Alt"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1541116800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541116800,"objectID":"71faa062a3b60a41d1ed2b9016d30f4b","permalink":"https://christophalt.github.io/publication/learning-explanations/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T14:36:16+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/learning-explanations/","section":"publication","summary":"PatternAttribution is a recent method, introduced in the vision domain, that explains classifications of deep neural networks.
